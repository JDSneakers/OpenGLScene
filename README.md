# OpenGLScene


--- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?


Working on this project helped me to develop creating reusable modular code. This is a crucial skill in coding as it allows you to create cleaner code that can easily be implemented in many different use cases.


--- What design process did you follow for your project work?


Stepwise process.


--- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?


In future work I can apply tactics from my design by planning the code and building it out incrementally in modular parts.


--- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?


I built the scene up slowly adding more elements over time to create the final result.


--- How did iteration factor into your development?


As each feature was added to the scene it began to take shape first with the complex object, then things were added in iterations such as the texturing, lighting, along with all the objects that would be in the scene.


--- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


I have learned the value of creating code in reusable functions that makes it easier and cleaner to edit and read lots of code as it builds up over iterations.



--- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?


Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new skills and knowledge to face complex solutions with many moving parts and functions that had to be utilized to find the end result, this will benefit me in school as I face more complex problems preparing for graduation.


--- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?


Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new skills and knowledge that when practiced throughout my educational pathway will prepare me for dealing with potentially huge complex code sets that the employer may have already.
